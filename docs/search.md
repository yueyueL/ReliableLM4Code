Just the Docs uses [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com) to add a client-side search interface powered by a JSON index that Jekyll generates.
All search results are shown in an auto-complete style interface (there is no search results page).
By default, all generated HTML pages are indexed using the following data points:

- Page title
- Page content
- Page URL

## Enable search in configuration

In your site's `_config.yml`, enable search:

```yaml
# Enable or disable the site search
# Supports true (default) or false
search_enabled: true
```

### Search granularity

Pages are split into sections that can be searched individually.
The sections are defined by the headings on the page.
Each section is displayed in a separate search result.

```yaml
# Split pages into sections that can be searched individually
# Supports 1 - 6, default: 2
search.heading_level: 2
```

### Search previews

A search result can contain previews that show where the search words are found in the specific section.

```yaml
# Maximum amount of previews per search result
# Default: 3
search.previews: 3

# Maximum amount of words to display before a matched word in the preview
# Default: 5
search.preview_words_before: 5

# Maximum amount of words to display after a matched word in the preview
# Default: 10
search.preview_words_after: 10
```

### Search tokenizer

The default is for hyphens to separate tokens in search terms:
`gem-based` is equivalent to `gem based`, matching either word.
To allow search for hyphenated words:

```yaml
# Set the search token separator
# Default: /[\s\-/]+/
# Example: enable support for hyphenated search words
search.tokenizer_separator: /[\s/]+/
```
