# Reliable Lanugage Models for Code
{: .fs-9 }
Welcome to our pages for research into Reliable Language Models for Code (LM4Code). Our comprehensive survey and ongoing research delve into the robustness, accuracy, and reliability of LM-based code generation and understanding. We scrutinize state-of-the-art models, dissect their performance across diverse datasets, and propose novel frameworks for evaluating and enhancing their reliability. Here, relevant researchers can find relevant studies, our key findings, and a collaborative space for advancing the field of reliable LM4Code.
