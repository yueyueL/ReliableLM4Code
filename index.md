# Reliable Lanugage Models for Code (LM4Code)
{: .fs-9 }
Collections of research and resources towards more robust and reliable LLMs for software engineering tasks.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This repository extends from our previous survey paper, "[Pitfalls in Language Models for Code Intelligence: A Taxonomy and Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17903)". It includes necessary information for our research and a curated collection of LM4Code papers and other resources (datasets, tutorials, etc.). The focus is primarily on papers that use pre-trained models, especially large language models, to improve the reliability of language models in Software Engineering research.

## About our survey
Our survey paper, “Pitfalls in Language Models for Code Intelligence: A Taxonomy and Survey”, discusses how Language Models for Code Intelligence (LM4Code) are susceptible to potential pitfalls. These pitfalls can hinder realistic performance and impact their reliability and applicability in real-world deployment.

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the pitfalls in language models for code intelligence. We propose a taxonomy of pitfalls in LM4Code research and conduct a systematic study to summarize the issues, implications, current solutions, and challenges of different pitfalls for LM4Code systems. We have developed a comprehensive classification scheme that dissects pitfalls across four crucial aspects: data collection and labeling, system design and learning, performance evaluation, and deployment and maintenance. We hope this survey can help researchers and practitioners understand the pitfalls in language models for code intelligence and develop more robust language models for code intelligence.
