## About our survey
Our survey paper "[Pitfalls in Language Models for Code Intelligence: A Taxonomy and Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17903)" . **language models for code intelligence (LM4Code) are susceptible to potential pitfalls, which hinder realistic performance and further impact their reliability and applicability in real-world deployment**.
This paper is a comprehensive survey of the pitfalls in language models for code intelligence. We propose a taxonomy of pitfalls in language models for code intelligence, and survey 67 papers in this field. we designed a taxonomy of pitfalls in LM4Code research and conducted a systematic study to summarize the issues, implications, current solutions, and challenges of different pitfalls for LM4Code systems. We developed a comprehensive classification scheme that dissects pitfalls across four crucial aspects: data collection and labeling, system design and learning, performance evaluation, and deployment and maintenance.. We hope this survey can help researchers and practitioners to understand the pitfalls in language models for code intelligence, and to develop more robust language models for code intelligence.
